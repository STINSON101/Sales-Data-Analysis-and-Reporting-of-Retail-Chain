# Title: Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Reporting-of-Retail-Chain 
### by Stinson Fernandes on 4th August 2023

## Objective:
Use python(jupyter notebook) and Excel to analyze sales data and generate meaningful reports for a Retail Chain.
## Summary:
This internship's final project focuses on a retail chain's performance evaluation, aiming to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses and discover growth opportunities. By analyzing diverse data sets, including sales and customer information. The project will utilize Python and Excel to gather, clean, and analyze the data, generating actionable insights that will inform decision-making strategies for the retail chain's success. 

Highlight of this dataset is that you can evaluate the effectiveness RFM group by checking the one of the business metric; the response of customers.
## Phase 1: Data Collection.
In this case study I have Downloaded the [Retail data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/regivm/retailtransactiondata?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=kaggle-dataset-share&utm_source=linkedin) from kaggle. the downlaoded data was properly stored. 

Thw data shows Transaction data provides customer_id, transaction date and Amount of purchase. Response data provides the response information of each of the customers. It is a binary variable indicating whether the customer responded to a campaign or not.

## Phase 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation.
After collecting and properly storing data we move to cleaning and preparing the data for further analysis. for this I used jupyter notbook I loaded the required libraries and modules requied for this process, imported both the csv files and merged it into one dataframe. removed null values and corrected data types and also created columns as per requirement. 

you can see in the following where I have imported and joined both the dataset:

After cleaning and preparing the dataset we move to next phase. you can check out the whole process [here](https://github.com/STINSON101/Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Reporting-of-Retail-Chain/blob/main/Retail%20Sales%20Data.ipynb)

## Phase 3: Data Analysis

In this phase I used EDA (explore data analysis) and identify trends and patterns, I have Performed more complex analysis as needed. For 
example, time series analysis for sales trends, cohort analysis for customer behavior, etc. Python's advanced data analysis libraries can be very useful here. you can check the analysis done [here](https://github.com/STINSON101/Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Reporting-of-Retail-Chain/blob/main/Retail%20Sales%20Data.ipynb)

## Phase 4: Reporting
This is the final stage of the analysis process here I Created summary tables showing sales by product, store, month, etc, reate visual reports (charts, graphs, etc) showing trends and patterns and Presented the reports to in [Excel dashboard](https://github.com/STINSON101/Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Reporting-of-Retail-Chain/blob/main/Sales%20data%20analysis%20and%20reporting%20for%20a%20retail%20chain.xlsx).
